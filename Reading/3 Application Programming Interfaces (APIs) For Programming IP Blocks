	• What does XGpio_WriteReg() do? What functions call it? Is it a function or a macro?
		○ Write a value to a GPIO register
		○ Functions 
			§ XGpio_SetDataDirection(XGpio * InstancePtr, unsigned Channel,
			    u32 DirectionMask)
			§ XGpio_DiscreteWrite(XGpio * InstancePtr, unsigned Channel, u32 Data)
		○ Macro 
	• XIntc_EnableIntr() accepts two parameters: BaseAddress and EnableMask. What are these
	parameters? Is it a function or a macro?
		○ BaseAddress - the base address of the device 32-bit value
		○ EnableMask - 32-bit value to write to the enable register. Each bit of the mask corresponds to an interrupt input signal. that is connected to the interrupt controller (INT0 = LSB).Only the bits which are set in the mask will enable interrupts.
		○ Macro 
	• What is the purpose of XIN_IAR_OFFSET?
		○ Interrupt Acknowledge Register
	• What service do you think that the macro Xil_Out32 performs? Can you find where this function is defined?
		○ appropriate I/O access method to memory mapped I/O or DCR.
	• What does the xparameters.h file contain? Why is this file significant?
		○ static config table functions and macros
		○ Initiate 
	• What is the significance of XPAR_PUSH_BUTTONS_5BITS_BASEADDR (contained in the xparameters.h file)?
